# FORMAT OF SCRIPTING:
# The only variable that will be checked by the program is "Events".
# The format of events is as follows:

# Terms are delimited by colons
# First term is name of script variable
# Second term is the trigger : position and radius

# In Scripts:
# msg() - contents of variable between brackets will be displayed in text box
# velocity() - variable between brackets is new velocity
# position() - variable between brackets is new position
# acceleration() - variable between brackets is new acceleration
# camposition() - set camera pos.
# camvelocity() - set camera vel.
# addposition() - adds to the position
# noinput - calls Input->Clear()
# waitforenter - waits for the action key to be pressed
# delay() - wait in seconds. Clear input. Velocity = 0.
# delete - delete event from script (so that it doesn't happen again)
# nomsg - stop message being displayed
# loadlevel() - load the level named between the brackets
# camposbezier() - move the camera with bezier curve between brackets. Supports 
#  	  	   multiple control points. First double is time taken.
# fadetomusic() - integer between brackets is the number of the music to fade to.
#		  Streamed and module music each have own numbering.
#		  Streamed nums start at 100 and module at 0.

# Variable parameters:
# specifying "start" as a position sets position to starting pos. of BallDude
